# Java Programming Internship - Codsoft

This repository contains the tasks and projects I completed during my Java Programming Internship at Codsoft from 1st October to 31st October, 2024. Throughout the internship, I worked on five distinct projects, enhancing my skills in Java programming and object-oriented principles.
Below is a brief overview of each project:

# 1. Number Game -:
A simple interactive game where the user guesses a number within a specified range. The program provides hints to guide the player, improving user experience and engagement.

# 2. Student Grade Calculator -:
This application calculates the final grades of students based on their input scores across different subjects. It handles grade point averaging and provides a final grade based on the performance.

# 3. ATM Interface -:
A simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system, allowing users to perform operations such as balance inquiries, withdrawals, deposits, and changing PINs, all through a text-based interface.

# 4. Quiz Application with Timer -:
A quiz application where users can attempt multiple-choice questions within a time limit. The timer ensures that the quiz is completed within a specified period, adding a layer of challenge.

# 5. Student Course Registration System -:
A system that allows students to register for courses by selecting from a list of available courses. It handles student information, course availability, and registration status.
